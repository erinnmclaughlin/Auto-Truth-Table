# Automatic Truth Table

This class library was generated as an extra credit project for a Discrete Mathematics course. The console interface will ask a user for a statement of operations on propositions. The `.Write()` method of the `TruthTable` class will then automatically write out a truth table.

#### Future improvements:
- Add support for "NOT" operator
- More automatic knowledge of order of operations (i.e., require less parenthesis from user)
- Verify format of user input
